## Site History
Initially, JAK LINUX was supposed to be a Linux distribution based on
Debian GNU/Linux 4.0, shipping standard Debian packages plus some packages
from a custom repository. This plan never really took of, and the site has
since become a place where my projects are hosted.

## Site Technology
The JAK LINUX is powered by [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info), a free wiki
compiler. Only a static export of the website is available, because there
is no support for dynamic content on the server this site is hosted.
The design is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), from
Twitter, in version 3.3.7, and is licensed under the [MIT license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twbs/bootstrap/v3.3.7/LICENSE).
The source code for the website is available at <http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/jak/website.git;a=summary>.
