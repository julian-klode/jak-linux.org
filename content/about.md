My name is Julian Andres Klode, I'm a Debian Developer and Ubuntu Member,
amongst other things. I maintain various software taken over from others,
such as dir2ogg and ndisgtk;
participate in the development of Debian-related software such as
APT and its Python bindings;
and develop some other software myself, such as hardlink.

## Site History
Initially, JAK LINUX was supposed to be a Linux distribution based on
Debian GNU/Linux 4.0, shipping standard Debian packages plus some packages
from a custom repository. This plan never really took of, and the site has
since become a place where my projects are hosted.

## Site Technology
The JAK LINUX site is powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), a free static site
generator. It is hosted on [uberspace](https://uberspace.de/), domains are provided by
[INWX](https://www.inwx.de/).

The design is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), from
Twitter, in version 3.3.7, and is licensed under the [MIT license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twbs/bootstrap/v3.3.7/LICENSE).
The source code for the website is available at <http://github.com/julian-klode/jak-linux.org>.
